<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf. These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

The comovement of financial variables between countries is a well researched topic. Particularly, the advent of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) challenged what we know about the dynamics between international variables, with many established correlations breaking down after the GFC. Similarly, exchange rate comovements between emerging markets change during periods of economic uncertainty, such as oil price shocks, economic crashes, bank and currency crises and even across general business cycle up- and downswings. 

This paper employs a Markov-switching GARCH (MS-GARCH) model on emerging market (EM) exchange rates in order to analyse the correlation between these currencies during periods (regimes) of high and low volatility. MS-GARCH models, since \@Hamilton(1990) introduced the concept, have become a popular method for analysing the dynamics of financial variables through time.



> I suggest renaming the top line after \@article, as done in the template ref.bib file, to something more intuitive for you to remember. Do not change the rest of the code. Also, be mindful of the fact that bib references from google scholar may at times be incorrect. Reference Latex forums for correct bibtex notation.

To reference a section, you have to set a label using ``\\label'' in R, and then reference it in-text as e.g.: section \ref{Data}.


Writing in Rmarkdown is surprizingly easy - see [this website](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) cheatsheet for a summary on writing Rmd writing tips.

# Data \label{Data}

Exchange rate series for 41 different countries are used.^[See appendix for full list of exchange rates] The exchange rate are analysed at a weekly frequencty, as daily closing exchange rates create difficult analysis due to differing time zones. All exchange rates are shown relative to the US dollar. the period under analysis covers 1990-2019.

                          Title = "", # I prefer to use the caption set above.

# When you start working, delete these meaningless functions and replace with your own...

```

To reference the plot above, add a ``\\label'' after the caption in the chunk heading, as done above. Then reference the plot as such: As can be seen, figure \ref{Figure1} is excellent. The nice thing now is that it correctly numbers all your figures (and sections or tables) and will update if it moves. The links are also dynamic.

I very strongly suggest using ggplot2 (ideally in combination with dplyr) using the ggtheme package to change the themes of your figures.

Also note the information that I have placed above the chunks in the code chunks for the figures. You can edit any of these easily - visit the Rmarkdown webpage for more information.

Here follows another figure from built-in ggplot2 data:

```{r figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Diamond Cut Plot \\label{lit}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

g <-
ggplot(diamonds, aes(depth, fill = cut, colour = cut)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_bw()

print(g)  

```


#  Methodology

This section presents a layout of a simple MS-GARCH framework, as described in Hamilton (1990). This Markov-switching framework assumes two distinct states under which exchange rates evolve: a high-volatility and low-volatility. The high volatility state is denoted by 
\begin{align}
S_t &=i
\end{align}

where \begin i &= 0,1 \end depending on the state. 0 denotes the low volatility regime, whereas 1 denotes the high volatility regime
## Math section

Equations should be written as such:

\begin{align} 
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \label{eq1} \\ 
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1 \notag
\end{align}

If you would like to see the equations as you type in Rmarkdown, use $ symbols instead (see this for yourself by adjusted the equation):

$$
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \\ 
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1
$$

Note again the reference to equation \ref{eq1}. Writing nice math requires practice. Note I used a forward slashes to make a space in the equations. I can also align equations using  __\&__, and set to numbering only the first line. Now I will have to type ``begin equation'' which is a native \LaTeX command. Here follows a more complicated equation:


\begin{align} 
	y_t &= c + B(L) y_{t-1} + e_t   \label{eq2}    \\ \notag 
	e_t &= H_t^{1/2}  z_t ; \quad z_t \sim  N(0,I_N) \quad \& \quad H_t = D_tR_tD_t \\ \notag
		D_t^2 &= {\sigma_{1,t}, \dots, \sigma_{N,t}}   \\ \notag
		\sigma_{i,t}^2 &= \gamma_i+\kappa_{i,t}  v_{i, t-1}^2 +\eta_i  \sigma_{i, t-1}^2, \quad \forall i \\ \notag
		R_{t, i, j} &= {diag(Q_{t, i, j}}^{-1}) . Q_{t, i, j} . diag(Q_{t, i, j}^{-1})  \\ \notag
		Q_{t, i, j} &= (1-\alpha-\beta)  \bar{Q} + \alpha  z_t  z_t'  + \beta  Q_{t, i, j} \notag
\end{align}

Note that in \ref{eq2} I have aligned the equations by the equal signs. I also want only one tag, and I create spaces using ``quads''. 

See if you can figure out how to do complex math using the two examples provided in \ref{eq1} and \ref{eq2}.

# Results


Tables can be included as follows. Use the _xtable_ (or kable) package for tables. Table placement = H implies Latex tries to place the table Here, and not on a new page (there are, however, very many ways to skin this cat. Luckily there are many forums online!).


```{r ShortTable, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)
data <- mtcars[1:5,] %>% tbl_df()

table <- xtable(data, caption = "Short Table Example \\label{tab1}")
  print.xtable(table, 
             # tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = TRUE,
             table.placement = 'H', 
             # scalebox = 0.3, 
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'bottom'
             )

```

To reference calculations __in text__, _do this:_ From table \ref{tab1} we see the average value of mpg is `r mean(mtcars[1:5,]$mpg)`.

Including tables that span across pages, use the following (note that I add below the table: ``continue on the next page''). This is a neat way of splitting your table across a page.

Use the following default settings to build your own possibly long tables. Note that the following will fit on one page if it can, but cleanly spreads over multiple pages:

```{r LongTable, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)

data = mtcars %>% tbl_df()
  addtorow          <- list()
  addtorow$pos      <- list()
  addtorow$pos[[1]] <- c(0)
  addtorow$command  <- c(paste("\\hline \n",
                               "\\endhead \n",
                               "\\hline \n",
                               "{\\footnotesize Continued on next page} \n",
                               "\\endfoot \n",
                               "\\endlastfoot \n",sep=""))
table <- xtable(data, caption = "Long Table Example")
  print.xtable(table, 
             tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = FALSE, # Leave this as is.
             table.placement = 'H', # Leave this as is.
             booktabs = T, # Aesthetics
             include.rownames = FALSE,  # Typically you don't want this in a table.
             add.to.row = addtorow, # For adding the Continued on next page part...
             comment = FALSE, 
             caption.placement = 'top',  # Where do you want the caption?
             size="\\fontsize{12pt}{13pt}\\selectfont"  # Size of text in table..
             )
# See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/vignettes/xtableGallery.pdf for table inspiration
```

<!-- hfill can be used to create a space, like here between text and table. -->


## Huxtable

Huxtable is a very nice package for making working with tables between Rmarkdown and Tex easier.

This cost some adjustment to the Tex templates to make it work, but it now works nicely.

See documentation for this package [here](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxtable.html). A particularly nice addition of this package is for making the printing of regression results a joy (see [here](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxtable.html#creating-a-regression-table)). Here follows an example:


If you are eager to use huxtable, comment out the Huxtable table in the Rmd template, and uncomment the colortbl package in your Rmd's root.

Note that I do not include this in the ordinary template, as some latex users have complained it breaks when they build their Rmds (especially those using tidytex - I don't have this problem as I have the full Miktex installed on mine). Up to you, but I strongly recommend installing the package manually and using huxtable. To make this work, uncomment the _Adding additional latex packages_ part in yaml at the top of the Rmd file. Then comment out the huxtable example in the template below this line. Reknit, and enjoy.

<!-- ```{r, results = 'asis'} -->

<!-- library(huxtable) -->

<!-- data(diamonds, package = 'ggplot2') -->

<!-- Title <- "Regression Output" -->
<!-- Label <- "Reg01" -->

<!-- lm1 <- lm(price ~ carat, diamonds) -->
<!-- lm2 <- lm(price ~ depth, diamonds) -->
<!-- lm3 <- lm(price ~ carat + depth, diamonds) -->
<!-- lm4 <- lm(price ~ carat*depth, diamonds) -->

<!-- htab <- -->
<!-- huxreg(lm1, lm2, lm3, lm4, -->
<!--                 statistics = c(N = "nobs", R2 = "r.squared"), -->
<!--                 note = "%stars%.") %>% -->
<!--   set_caption(Title) %>% -->
<!--   set_label(Label) %>% -->
<!--   set_width(.6) -->

<!-- # More settings: -->
<!-- font_size(htab) <- 12 -->

<!-- # Let's change regression names: this is slightly hacky, but works. Comment out this section to see what the default looks like: -->
<!--   Names <- c("Reg1", "Reg2", "Reg3", "Reg4") -->
<!--   for(i in 1:ncol(htab)) { -->
<!--     htab[1,][[1+i]] <- Names[i] -->
<!--   } -->

<!-- # Now simply call the table: -->

<!-- htab -->

<!-- ``` -->

FYI - R also recently introduced the gt package, which is worthwhile exploring too. 

# Lists

To add lists, simply using the following notation

* This is really simple

    + Just note the spaces here - writing in R you have to sometimes be pedantic about spaces...
  
* Note that Rmarkdown notation removes the pain of defining \LaTeX environments!

# Conclusion
